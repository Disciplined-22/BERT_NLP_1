# SMS Spam Classification with DistilBERT

## Overview

This repository contains code for training a DistilBERT-based model to classify SMS messages as spam or not spam. The model is fine-tuned using TensorFlow and the Hugging Face Transformers library.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is the "SMSSpamCollection" dataset, which consists of SMS messages labeled as spam or not spam.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Other dependencies (specified in `requirements.txt`)

## Usage
